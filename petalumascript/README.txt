Petaluma Script 1.10
https://github.com/steinbergmedia/petaluma/tree/master/redist



The original PetalumaScript WOFF files from GitHub seem to have poor kerning.
The spacing is different than the OTF files.


Instead, we used https://cloudconvert.com/otf-to-woff2 to convert the OTF file to WOFF2.
