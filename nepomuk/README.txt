Nepomuk 2.078

This font family is inspired by the type commonly found in music plate engraving from the late 19th to the mid 20th-century.

Based on characters designed by Florian Kretlow, the family has been expanded by Ben Byram-Wigfield. Bold and Bold Italic weights have been created; kerning and tracking has been improved, and a greater range of characters added. Glyphs have been revised throughout. Additions includes more diacritics and non-Roman characters (for all your Czech and Icelandic composers), and punctuation, including non-breaking hyphens. There are also extra characters of use in music, such as Unicode music accidentals, and versicle and response symbols.

The text is deliberately 'quite tight', so that it can be used for lyrics without overly distorting note spacing; users may want to apply letter spacing (tracking) for titling and other page furniture. 

The accidentals can be accessed using the ligatures $b, $n, and $s, or directly using their Unicode values U+266D - U+266F).

v2.01: More improvements to kerning; Small Caps have been added to Regular and Bold styles.  
v2.02: More kerning revisions! Also Unicode Roman Numerals to Regular and Italic styles.
v2.07: Bold and Bold Italic styles have been improved.
